DECISIONS:
	* Keep the tile images the same size as one another.
	  This could be generalized, of course.

	CreateSubImage should use shrinkImage
	ShrinkImage should get neatened

0.  Which examples?
	Fuchs, Garage

1.  Conceptually: Create a tile image and base image. Then transfer
some of the properties from the base image to the tile image.

	(b)  Smooth the tile image before transferring the
	properties. 
	(c)  Drag and drop of some tiles?


3.  Integrate the modern pyramid code into the spline code.

4.  Review structure of patent

5.  Add comments and neaten the Matlab code generally.  More
functions?  Anything else?

2.  Review the methods of creating tile images to include (a) random
position and scale, (b) uniformly tiled.  The size of the tile images
could be variable as well.
	(a)  For example,make monochrome tiles, transfer the color
