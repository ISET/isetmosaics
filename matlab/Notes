1.  First, take the black and white images of arbitrary sizes
and code them into a couple of matrices that denote the image
sizes and the row and col sizes of the image.\

2.  Second, merge the black and white images into an image that has
the same shape as the base image.

3.  Then, go through the black and white merged image in NxN squares and assign
each square the same color and contrast as the base image.
