The directory is /wusr4/gigi/MATLAB/TILES
 
There is a read me file there

cmosaic.m  -  mosiacs one big image with many small ones neads an array of 
              file names which can be created using create_fname_list.m

combine_cmosaic.m - mosaics 2 big images where one wil be seen from afar
              (using it's color content) and the other from up close (using
              it's textural content) 

create_fname_list.m - creates an array with file names, used for cmosaic.m

spline_tile.m - splines (smoothes) the tiles in a tiled image.
                uses the pyramid package.

create_random.m - creates a random tiling of small images into a single
                large image. Can be used to create input image for 
                combine_cmosaic.m
